#Tidy Data Information
This codebook pertains to the dataset tidy_data.txt. Information about the source data from which it was derived is located at the bottom of this codebook. 

#Variables
The first row of the data set contains the variable names. 
##Identifiers
*Subject 
Identifies the subject. Integer, range 1-30. 

*Activity identifier, string, with 6 possible values:
+ WALKING- Subject was walking
+ WALKING_UPSTAIRS- Subject was walking upstairs
+ WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS- Subject was walking downstairs
+ SITTING- Subject was sitting
+ STANDING- Subject was standing
+ LAYING- Subject was laying

##Features
Each feature in tidy_data.txt is an average of measurements from the source data- grouped by subject and activity and then averaged.  

Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

Prior to normalisation, acceleration measurements (variables containing Accelerometer) were made in g's (9.81 m.s⁻²) and gyroscope measurements (variables containing Gyroscope) were made in radians per second (rad.s⁻¹).

Magnitudes of three-dimensional signals (variables containing Magnitude) were calculated using the Euclidean norm.

##Time Domain
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeDomainAccelerationXYZ and timeDomainGyroscopeXYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeDomainBodyAccelerationXYZ and timeDomainGravityAccelerationXYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeDomainBodyAccelerationJerkXYZ and timeDomainBodyGyroscopeJerkXYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeDomainBodyAccelerationMagnitude, timeDomainGravityAccellerationMagnitude, timeDomainBodyAccelerationJerkMagnitude, timeDomainBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, timeDomainBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude).

#Transformations
Source data is located at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The following transformations were applied to the source data set to create the tidy data set: 
* Training and test data sets were merged to create one data set.

* The measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted, the others were not used.

* Numbers used to identify activities were replaced with descriptive activity names. 

* Variable names were cleaned up and replaced by descriptive variable names using the following steps:
+Special characters were removed (eg: "(", ")", "-").
+The prefixes "t" and "f" were expanded to "timeDomain" and "frequencyDomain", respectively. 
+Abbreviations were expanded. "Acc", "Gyro", "Mag", "Freq", "mean", and "std" were replaced with "Acceleration", "Gyroscope", "Magnitude", "Frequency", "Mean", and "StandardDeviation", respectively. 
+Duplicated word "BodyBody" was replaced with "Body". 

* From the data set in step 4, a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was created. This dataset is located under the file name tidy_data.txt. 





#Source Data Information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
